# 🎓 CS50x: Introduction to the Intellectual Enterprises of Computer Science

## 🌟 The Journey
Completing Harvard University's CS50x has been a transformative experience. This course didn't just teach me how to code; it taught me how to **think**. It took me from a beginner to someone who can confidently tackle complex algorithmic problems and build full-scale applications.

> **Special Thanks:** I want to express my deepest gratitude to **Professor David J. Malan** and the entire CS50 team. Their passion and unique way of teaching made me truly fall in love with Computer Science. They turned a daunting subject into an exciting adventure.

## 📚 What I Learned (Technical Syllabus)

### 🔴 Low-Level Programming & Memory (C)
* **Foundations:** Functions, variables, and control flow.
* **Memory Management:** Deep dive into pointers, heap vs. stack, and manual memory allocation (`malloc`/`free`).
* **Data Structures:** Building and navigating Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees, and Tries from scratch.
* **Algorithms:** Analyzing time and space complexity (**Big O notation**) while implementing Sorting (Merge, Bubble, Selection) and Searching (Binary vs. Linear).

### 🐍 High-Level Scripting (Python)
* **Transition:** Moving from the strictness of C to the efficiency of Python.
* **Data Processing:** Using Python for automation and handling complex data types.
* **Integration:** Utilizing libraries to build robust back-end logic.

### 🌐 Web Development & Databases
* **SQL:** Designing relational databases, writing complex queries, and ensuring data integrity.
* **Full-Stack:** Building dynamic web applications using **Flask** (Python) for the backend and **Jinja2** for templating.
* **Frontend:** Mastering the basics of **HTML5**, **CSS3** (Bootstrap), and **JavaScript**.

### 🛡️ CyberSecurity & Ethics
* Understanding security vulnerabilities, hashing, and the ethical implications of technology in the modern world.

## 📈 Growth Reflection
CS50x taught me that **"what ultimately matters is not where you are relative to your peers, but where you are relative to yourself yesterday."** This mindset is what I carry with me as I move forward into my career in software engineering.
