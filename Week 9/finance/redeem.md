C$50 Finance
It is a web application where a person can "buy" and "sell" stocks based on IEX actual stock information. It is a full-stack application developed during Week 9 of Harvard University’s CS50x.

What it does

The application enables the user to register for an account, search for the current stock prices, and track their virtual portfolio. Every transaction (buy or sell) is stored inside a database, and the "cash" value is automatically updated.

The Tech Stack

Python & Flask: For implementing backend logic & routes.

SQL (SQLite): Handling User, Transactions, and Portfolios.

HTML & Bootstrap: For a clean and responsive interface.

Jinja2: Dynamic rendering of data from the server to the browser. The Logic The toughest aspect for me was always keeping the math accurate: figuring how much the stocks were worth based on real-time market info, in addition to ensuring that a user doesn’t spend more money than they have. I gained experience on how to handle sessions (enabling users to stay logged in) and how to connect a web form to a database. I would like to thank Neso Academy very much for the SQL and relationship explanations in the database. They really eased the explanation of how to set my tables up so that all of my trades are thoroughly tracked.
